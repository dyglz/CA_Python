# Task 3: Nested List and Dictionary Manipulation with Functions
# Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents 
# a person with their name and a list of their test scores. 
# The function should:
# Return the average score for each person.
# Create and return a new list of dictionaries with each dictionary containing 
# the person's name and their highest test score.
 
# [
#   {"name": "Alice", "scores": [85, 90, 78]},
#   {"name": "Bob", "scores": [88, 92, 95]},
#   {"name": "Charlie", "scores": [78, 80, 72]}
# ]
# -> (
#   [84.33, 91.67, 76.67],
